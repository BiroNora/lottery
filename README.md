About the project

The purpose of this program is to verify whether the numbers you intend to play in Hungarian lottery games, especially in Pick-5, Pick-6, or Scandinavian lottery, have ever been drawn before. UI is optimized for mobile users, as well as including a responsive navigation bar. The numbers undergo weekly uploads. Have fun with it!
